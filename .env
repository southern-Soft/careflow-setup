# --- Port Configurations ---
# Change these values to update the external ports exposed to your machine

# Databases (Host side)
USERS_DB_PORT=5432
ORDERS_DB_PORT=5435

# Apps (Host side)
BACKEND_PORT=8000
FRONTEND_PORT=3000

# Connectivity Note:
# Inside Docker, the services always talk to each other via internal names (e.g., http://backend:8000).
# The ports above are what YOU use to access the apps from your browser.
# Example: http://localhost:3000 for Frontend, http://localhost:8000/docs for Backend API.
